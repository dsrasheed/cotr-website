# [Colors of the Region Event Website](http://cotr.herokuapp.com)

The event was held on June 30, 2017. This website provided info about the purpose of the event and enabled attenders to purchase tickets, print them, and have them verified when they arrived.

### Using the Ticket Purchase System

I use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to accept payments. Since the event ended, my Stripe account is now in testing mode so that it will no longer accept purchases from real cards. In order to see the ticket system work, you can put in the dummy number 4242 4242 4242 4242 for the "card number" field and any random numbers for "MM/YY" and "CVC". The website will send an email to your address containing the link to print your dummy tickets.
