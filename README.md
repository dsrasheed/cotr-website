# [Colors of the Region Event Website](http://cotr.herokuapp.com)

The event was held on June 30, 2017. This website provided info about the purpose of the event and enabled attenders to purchase tickets, print them, and have them verified when they arrived.

### Using the Ticket Purchase System

I use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to accept payments from cards. Since the event ended, my Stripe account is in testing mode. To see the ticket system in action, a real card number cannot be entered. Instead, enter the dummy card number "4242 4242 4242 4242" and random numbers for the "MM/YY" and "CVC" fields. The website will send an email to your address containing the link to print your dummy tickets.
